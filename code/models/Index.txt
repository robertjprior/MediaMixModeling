NOTES:
1. we have to be careful of functional form with the unsaturated channels that we don't just completely turn that 0-100.
It may soon saturate at a level just out of bounds of what we have seen. The best approach is to do some testing over time with slightly higher levels

2. Add in other variables like seasonal control variables (can be developed with prophet) and price variables

3. Can do testing with made up data (I think done in article 3)

4. Can put this into the Pystan library to make this easier I think, not entirely sure of hte difference. I think it may just be better at optimizing hyperparams than Optuna

5. There is some library in python than can also do budget optimization with legrange

6. Scaling of exogenous variables can be important

7. Article 4 talks about spend vs exposure if we don't have advertising spend but more just number
of people exposed to the various types of marketing

8. Test the scaling of the response variable between 0 and 1 or just divide by  x multiple of 10

9. If we have a long time series, do we need to scale the impact of marketing $s to be nonlinear?

10.  LOOK AT ROBYN OPENSOURCE LIBRARAY WHICH DOES THIS ALL

11. Since Robyn additionally optimizes a business-relevant metric, it has fewer chances to generate a model that is statistically accurate but unrealistic from the marketing perspective

12. BE AWARE OF RESPONSE DISTRIBUTION IF NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED

13. Check the distribution of hyperparams too easily with Pystan or equivalent from article 4

14. evaluate with NRMSE (normalized Root Mean Squared Error - basically just RMSE) and MAPE (Mean Abs Percent Error) which will reflect different issues that could arise


Visual Analysis:
*Article 4 has a lot on this

1. Weights across platforms
2. saturation across platforms
3. share of spend vs share of effect for each platform (normalized and non normalized)
4. ROI
5. Plot over time of true values with predicted as a time series where true points are just circles every once in a while
